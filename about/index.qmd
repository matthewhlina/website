I am a mixed methods researcher with my most recent experience at the University of Minnesota in the sport management program and [Global Institute for Responsible Sport Organizations](https://girso.umn.edu). I grew up in a modest home in the unincorporated town of South Range, Wisconsin and spent my first 18 years under the same roof, although I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I enjoy being active, playing board games, reading about history, listening to my favorite podcasts, spending time with friends, and trying new things. I'm passionate about human, societal, and environmental health and solving problems in these fields through quantitative and qualitative methods.
