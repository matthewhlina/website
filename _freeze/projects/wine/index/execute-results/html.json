Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.](index_files/figure-html/fig-scatter-1.png){#fig-scatter width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression analyses, either the x (rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed.\n\n### Creating Models\n\nIn accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to apply a downward power transformation to the y-variable by log-transforming wine price by the natural log. The natural log of wine price was then regressed on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that only included the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that included both wine rating *and* whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\n### Comparing Models\n\nUsing AICc and ${r}^2$ values to compare models, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data. The following table shows this comparison.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTable 1.

We then substituted Rating = 1, California = 1, and simplified the equation. The steps of this process are shown below.\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nDrawing from this simplified model, we can conclude that on average, each **one unit change** in wine rating (i.e., 86 to 87) is associated with a **1.28-fold increase** in the price of a wine. We can also conclude that being made in **California** (i.e., California = 1) is associated with a **1.17-fold increase** in the price of a wine. Finally, the differential price between wines from California and those made in a different region to increase as rating increases due to interactions between rating and being made in California. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3.](index_files/figure-html/fig-fits-1.png){#fig-fits width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n",
