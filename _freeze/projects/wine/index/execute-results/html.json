Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.](index_files/figure-html/fig-scatter-1.png){#fig-scatter width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression, either the x (wine rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed. In accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to log-transform wine price, which represents a downward power transformation of the y-variable, to create our first model, and then regressed it on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that includes the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that includes both wine rating *and* whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nUsing ${r}^2$ values for comparison, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data. The following table provides a comparison of all models.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTable 1.

We then substituted Rating = 1 and California = 1 and solved:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that on average, each one unit change in rating is associated with a 1.28-fold increase in price. We can also conclude that a wine being made in California is associated with a 1.17-fold increase in price. This causes the differential price between wines made in California and wines made elsewhere to increase as rating increases. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3.](index_files/figure-html/fig-fits-1.png){#fig-fits width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n",
