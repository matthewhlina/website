We will utilize each team's fan cost index (FCI) for a particular a season, although there is no data from 2012 because the NHL experienced a lockout. FCI is calculated by summing the prices of four average-price tickets, two small draft beers, four small soft drinks, four regular-size hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs, and two least-expensive, adult-size adjustable caps, for a season. Here is a figure displaying the relationship between FCI and years since 2002 for each team and an average growth trendline displayed in bold.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cost of attending a NHL game (FCI) over time for each NHL team. The black line represents the average cost of attending NHL games.](index_files/figure-html/fig-spaghetti-1.png){#fig-spaghetti width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe average growth model appears to be positive and linear, although there may be evidence supporting a quadratic relationship in the data. We will consider three models in our analysis: a) an uncondiational random intercepts model; b) an unconditional linear growth model; and c) an unconditional quadratic growth model. Here is a table of the unstandardized coefficients and standard errors for these models.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTable 1.

While both variation between and within teams exist, the variation between teams (58.50%) accounts for more variation than the variation within team (41.50%). In practical terms, this means that a team's FCI in 2002 (the y-intercept) explains more variation than the rate of change of a team's FCI (slope). Here is the equation for this model:\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{FCI}_{i}} &= 244.82+ 5.21(\\mathrm{Year-2002}_{ij}) + 0.41(\\mathrm{Year-2002}_{ij})^2 +\\mathrm{b_{0j}}\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nAdditionally, here is a figure that presents our model as well as a trend line that represents the FCI for the Minnesota Wild NHL team.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Unconditional quadratic growth models showing the relationship between year and NHL fan cost index.
