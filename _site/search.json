    "text": "CSV\nCodebook\n\n\nThe literature has suggested that the price of wine is predictive of a wine’s rating which attempts to quantify a wine’s quality on a 100pt scale (Snipes & Taylor, 2014). Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression analyses, either the x (rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to apply a downward power transformation to the y-variable by log-transforming wine price by the natural log. The natural log of wine price was then regressed on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that only included the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that included both wine rating and whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing AICc and \\({r}^2\\) values to compare models, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data. The following table shows this comparison.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

We then substituted Rating = 1, California = 1, and simplified the equation. The steps of this process are shown below.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nDrawing from this simplified model, we can conclude that on average, each one unit change in wine rating (i.e., 86 to 87) is associated with a 1.28-fold increase in the price of a wine. We can also conclude that being made in California (i.e., California = 1) is associated with a 1.17-fold increase in the price of a wine. Finally, the differential price between wines from California and those made in a different region to increase as rating increases due to interactions between rating and being made in California. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3."

We controlled for GNI in this regression by including a dummy variable that assigned a 1 to countries with a high-gross national income (GNI) and a 0 to those with a low GNI. The figure and equation below show the model developed from this regression:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The relationship between female education level and fertility rate for women in high and low GNI countries.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Infant~Mortality~Rate}_i} &= 63.37- 3.6(\\mathrm{Female~Education~Level}_i) - 17.58(\\mathrm{GNI}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nThese results suggest that a one-unit change in female education level (or an additional year of formal education) is associated with a decreased infant mortality rate by 3.60 (or 3.60 less infant deaths before their first birthday, per 1000 live births).

In this model, the effect of female education on infant mortality decreases as female education level increases. Another way of saying this is that the negative effect of female education on infant mortality rate is greater at lower levels of education than it is at higher levels (i.e., there is a greater effect at education level 1 than at education level 12). This can be interpreted to mean that the initial years of female education are more critical to decreasing infant mortality than later years. Education still has an effect in these later stages but its effect diminishes.\nCountries with high levels of GNI are associated with a lower infant mortality rate, similar to findings from the linear model."

Each subsequent year is associated with an increase in FCI by at least 5.61 points. The effect of year on FCI increases over time.\nAdditionally, here is a figure that presents our model as well as a trend line that represents the FCI for the Minnesota Wild NHL team.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Unconditional quadratic growth models showing the relationship between year and NHL fan cost index.

    "text": "CSV\nCodebook\n\n\nThe literature has suggested that the price of wine is predictive of a wine’s rating which attempts to quantify a wine’s quality on a 100pt scale (Snipes & Taylor, 2014). Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression analyses, either the x (rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to apply a downward power transformation to the y-variable by log-transforming wine price by the natural log. The natural log of wine price was then regressed on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that only included the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that included both wine rating and whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing AICc and \\({r}^2\\) values to compare models, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data.

We then substituted Rating = 1, California = 1, and simplified the equation. The steps of this process are shown below.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nDrawing from this simplified model, we can conclude that on average, each one unit change in wine rating (i.e., 86 to 87) is associated with a 1.28-fold increase in the price of a wine. We can also conclude that being made in California (i.e., California = 1) is associated with a 1.17-fold increase in the price of a wine. Finally, the differential price between wines from California and those made in a different region to increase as rating increases due to interactions between rating and being made in California. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3."

It is calculated by summing the prices of four average-price tickets, two small draft beers, four small soft drinks, four regular-size hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs, and two least-expensive, adult-size adjustable caps, for a season.\nThis project assessed the longitudinal variation in cost of attending an NHL game from 2002-2014 by using FCI to denote cost (no data from 2012 due to lockout).

A Likert-scale was used to quantify the service attendance frequency predictor (0 = never; 4 = every week), making it necessary to determine whether this predictor should be treated as continuous or categorical before any regressing can be done. The below figure shows the relationship between support and attendance. Responses are dispersed above and below 0 and 1 on the y-axis to demonstrate that numerous data points were used to create the figure, although all these data points fall on either 0 or 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot with smoother showing the relationship between religious service attendance and support for same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between proportion of support and attendance appears to be linear, meaning the Likert-scale data can be treated as if it were continuous.\n\n\n\nFive models were created and compared to determine which most appropriately represents the data.
