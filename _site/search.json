    "text": "CSV\nCodebook\n\n\nThe literature has suggested that the price of wine is predictive of a wine’s rating which attempts to quantify a wine’s quality on a 100pt scale (Snipes & Taylor, 2014). Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression analyses, either the x (rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to apply a downward power transformation to the y-variable by log-transforming wine price by the natural log. The natural log of wine price was then regressed on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that only included the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that included both wine rating and whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing AICc and \\({r}^2\\) values to compare models, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data. The following table shows this comparison.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

We then substituted Rating = 1, California = 1, and simplified the equation. The steps of this process are shown below.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nDrawing from this simplified model, we can conclude that on average, each one unit change in wine rating (i.e., 86 to 87) is associated with a 1.28-fold increase in the price of a wine. We can also conclude that being made in California (i.e., California = 1) is associated with a 1.17-fold increase in the price of a wine. Finally, the differential price between wines from California and those made in a different region to increase as rating increases due to interactions between rating and being made in California. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3."

We controlled for GNI in this regression by including a dummy variable that assigned a 1 to countries with a high-gross national income (GNI) and a 0 to those with a low GNI.

In this model, the effect of female education on infant mortality decreases as female education level increases. Another way of saying this is that the negative effect of female education on infant mortality rate is greater at lower levels of education than it is at higher levels (i.e., there is a greater effect at education level 1 than at education level 12). This can be interpreted to mean that the initial years of female education are more critical to decreasing infant mortality than later years. Education still has an effect in these later stages but its effect diminishes.\nCountries with high levels of GNI are associated with a lower infant mortality rate, similar to findings from the linear model."

We will utilize each team’s fan cost index (FCI) for a particular a season, although there is no data from 2012 because the NHL experienced a lockout. FCI is calculated by summing the prices of four average-price tickets, two small draft beers, four small soft drinks, four regular-size hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs, and two least-expensive, adult-size adjustable caps, for a season. Here is a figure displaying the relationship between FCI and years since 2002 for each team and an average growth trendline displayed in bold.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cost of attending a NHL game (FCI) over time for each NHL team. The black line represents the average cost of attending NHL games.\n\n\n\n\nThe average growth model appears to be positive and linear, although there may be evidence supporting a quadratic relationship in the data.

    "text": "CSV\nCodebook\n\n\nThe literature has suggested that the price of wine is predictive of a wine’s rating which attempts to quantify a wine’s quality on a 100pt scale (Snipes & Taylor, 2014). Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression analyses, either the x (rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to apply a downward power transformation to the y-variable by log-transforming wine price by the natural log. The natural log of wine price was then regressed on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that only included the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that included both wine rating and whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\n\n\nUsing AICc and \\({r}^2\\) values to compare models, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data.

We then substituted Rating = 1, California = 1, and simplified the equation. The steps of this process are shown below.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nDrawing from this simplified model, we can conclude that on average, each one unit change in wine rating (i.e., 86 to 87) is associated with a 1.28-fold increase in the price of a wine. We can also conclude that being made in California (i.e., California = 1) is associated with a 1.17-fold increase in the price of a wine. Finally, the differential price between wines from California and those made in a different region to increase as rating increases due to interactions between rating and being made in California. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3."

We will utilize each team’s fan cost index (FCI) for a particular a season, although there is no data from 2012 because the NHL experienced a lockout. FCI is calculated by summing the prices of four average-price tickets, two small draft beers, four small soft drinks, four regular-size hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs, and two least-expensive, adult-size adjustable caps, for a season. Here is a figure displaying the relationship between FCI and years since 2002 for each team and an average growth trendline displayed in bold.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cost of attending a NHL game (FCI) over time for each NHL team. The black line represents the average cost of attending NHL games.\n\n\n\n\nThe average growth model appears to be positive and linear, although there may be evidence supporting a quadratic relationship in the data. We will consider three models in our analysis: a) an uncondiational random intercepts model; b) an unconditional linear growth model; and c) an unconditional quadratic growth model.
