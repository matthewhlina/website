    "text": "The literature has suggested that the price of wine is predictive of a wine’s rating which attempts to quantify a wine’s quality on a 100pt scale (Snipes & Taylor, 2014). Therefore, the relationship between wine rating and price was evaluated. The following scatter plot demonstrates this relationship for 200 wines made in seven geographic regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Scatterplot of the relationship between 200 wine prices and their ratings.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows a non-linear relationship between wine rating and price. In order to re-express the data to meet the linearity assumption of regression, either the x (wine rating) or y-variable (price) must be transformed. In accordance with the Rule of the Bulge, we elected to log-transform wine price, which represents a downward power transformation of the y-variable, to create our first model, and then regressed it on wine rating. The equation for this model is shown below:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~1}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.06 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nTwo additional models were made to examine other possible predictors of price: one that includes the effects of whether or not a wine is made in California and another that includes both wine rating and whether or not a wine is made in California:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mathrm{Model~2}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= 3.46 + 0.015(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\mathrm{Model~3}: \\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nUsing \\({r}^2\\) values for comparison, we determined that Model 3 was the most appropriate model for the data. The following table provides a comparison of all models.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

We then substituted Rating = 1 and California = 1 and solved:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\hat{\\mathrm{ln(Price_i)}} &= -19.48 + 0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i) + 0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(\\mathrm{Rating}_i)} \\times e^{0.16(\\mathrm{California}_i)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= e^{-19.48} \\times e^{0.25(1)} \\times e^{0.16(1)}\n\\\\[1em]\n\\hat{\\mathrm{Price_i}} &= (3.47 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.28 \\times 1.17\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nFrom this, we can conclude that on average, each one unit change in rating is associated with a 1.28-fold increase in price. We can also conclude that a wine being made in California is associated with a 1.17-fold increase in price. This causes the differential price between wines made in California and wines made elsewhere to increase as rating increases. The figure below demonstrates these findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Best fits for wines from CA and not from CA, according to Model 3."

    "text": "This project assesses the longitudinal variation in cost of attending an NHL game from 2002-2014. We will utilize each team’s fan cost index (FCI) for a particular a season, although there is no data from 2012 because the NHL experienced a lockout. FCI is calculated by summing the prices of four average-price tickets, two small draft beers, four small soft drinks, four regular-size hot dogs, parking for one car, two game programs, and two least-expensive, adult-size adjustable caps, for a season. Here is a figure displaying the relationship between FCI and years since 2002 for each team and an average growth trendline displayed in bold.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cost of attending a NHL game (FCI) over time for each NHL team. The black line represents the average cost of attending NHL games.\n\n\n\n\nThe average growth model appears to be positive and linear, although there may be evidence supporting a quadratic relationship in the data. We will consider three models in our analysis: a) an uncondiational random intercepts model; b) an unconditional linear growth model; and c) an unconditional quadratic growth model.
